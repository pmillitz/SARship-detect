*In Circular Phase Statistics, application being Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery interpretation, the circular mean and standard deviation are more appropriate measures of central tendency and dispersion respectively, correct?*

You're absolutely right. In Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery interpretation, especially when dealing with interferometric phase data, the phase is inherently an angular variable—typically confined to an interval like [0, 2π) or [–π, π). This cyclic nature means that standard linear statistics (like the arithmetic mean and regular standard deviation) can be misleading. For instance, simply averaging 359° and 1° would yield 180° in a linear framework, an outcome that does not accurately represent the central tendency of the data.

Instead, **circular statistics** are employed. The **circular mean** is calculated by considering the phase as points on the unit circle, usually by computing the arctan of the ratio of the summed sine and cosine components. This method naturally accounts for the wrap-around behavior of angular data. Similarly, the **circular standard deviation** (or circular dispersion) reflects how tightly the phase values cluster around the mean direction without suffering from the discontinuities that arise with linear measures. These measures are crucial when phase differences are used for constructing interferograms or extracting topographical information, where subtle errors in phase interpretation can lead to significant artifacts in the final imagery .

Moreover, applying circular statistical methods in SAR not only helps obtain more accurate estimates of central tendency and dispersion but also better reflects the physical properties inherent to the radar imaging process. The computed circular parameters allow for improved phase error control and correction, leading to more reliable interferometric reconstructions—a key task in many remote sensing and geophysical applications.

Beyond SAR, these concepts apply to any field dealing with periodic or directional data—for example, wind direction analysis or animal movement studies—but they become especially critical in high-resolution phase imaging where even minor processing errors can have a large impact on the interpretation of the scene.

Is there a particular aspect of using circular statistics in SAR that you’d like to dive deeper into, or perhaps a specific practical challenge you’re facing in your interpretation work?

*Indicate how low and high values of circular mean and circular standard deviation can be interpreted with examples and compare with regular phase mean and standard deviation*

Let's break it down with detailed examples and comparisons:

---

### 1. Overview of Circular Versus Regular Phase Statistics

When dealing with phase data, such as that from SAR interferometry, the values are inherently *angular* and wrap around at 360° (or 2π radians). Regular (linear) statistics treat numbers as if they lie on an infinite line, which can yield misleading results when the data “wraps around” the circle. In contrast, circular statistics handle this periodicity by mapping phase values onto a unit circle. This leads to two key measures:

- **Circular Mean:** Represents the average *direction* of the phase values.
- **Circular Standard Deviation:** Reflects the spread (dispersion) of the phase values around that mean.

---

### 2. Interpreting the Circular Mean

#### **Low Circular Mean:**

- **Interpretation:** A low circular mean (near 0° or close to a chosen reference angle) indicates that, on average, the phase measurements cluster around that reference point.
- **Example:**  
  Imagine a SAR image covering a calm water surface where phase values are 2°, 3°, and 359°.
  - **Circular mean:** Properly computed by mapping these angles onto the circle, the values 359° and 2° are nearly overlapping, so the mean might be around 0° or 1°.
  - **Physical Insight:** This suggests that the reflected signal is very consistent, showing high coherence.

#### **High (or Different) Circular Mean:**

- **Interpretation:** A circular mean farther from a reference (say, near 180°) might be expected in situations where the signal response (or an expected phase offset) differs. However, “high” isn’t so much a measure of quality as it is a reflection of the average phase “direction” of the data.
- **Example:**  
  In a region with an expected phase offset due to terrain elevation differences, the phase values might consistently cluster around 170°–190°.
  - **Circular mean:** Would correctly reflect this clustering (around 180°), even though the "value" is high in numerical terms.
  - **Physical Insight:** The mean here tells us the dominant phase shift and may be used to infer physical properties (like height variations).

Notice that while the concept of “low” or “high” values is straightforward in linear data, in circular data it’s the *relative clustering* that’s more important than the absolute number.

#### **Comparison with Regular Phase Mean:**

- **Regular (Arithmetic) Mean Issue:**  
  Consider the set {1°, 2°, 359°}. A linear mean would be:  
  
  $$
  (1 + 2 + 359) / 3 \approx 120°,
  $$
  
  which is completely off because it ignores the wrap-around nature.

- **Circular Mean Advantage:**  
  By mapping angles as points on the unit circle (using sine and cosine), the circular mean would recognize that 359° and 1° are very close, resulting in a mean near 0° or 360°.

---

### 3. Interpreting the Circular Standard Deviation

#### **Low Circular Standard Deviation:**

- **Interpretation:** A low circular standard deviation indicates that the phase values are tightly clustered around the circular mean. This is a sign of high phase coherence, often correlated with a uniform scattering mechanism.
- **Example:**  
  In a coherent area such as a flat, calm water surface, imagine phase values like 5°, 6°, and 7°.
  - **Circular standard deviation:** Would be very small (say, around 1° or less), signaling very little phase variation.
  - **Physical Insight:** This tight clustering is ideal in interferometry for accurate topographic or displacement retrieval.

#### **High Circular Standard Deviation:**

- **Interpretation:** A high circular standard deviation reveals that the phase measurements are widely spread around the circle. This means that the data is less coherent, which could be due to rough terrain, dense vegetation, or other sources of noise.
- **Example:**  
  Consider a forested or urban area where multipath scattering causes phase values like 30°, 150°, 270°, and 350°.
  - **Circular standard deviation:** Would be high, reflecting the scattered nature of the phases.
  - **Physical Insight:** A high dispersion suggests poor coherence in the SAR signal—this might signal areas where phase unwrapping could be problematic or where additional filtering is needed.

#### **Comparison with Regular Standard Deviation:**

- **Regular (Arithmetic) Standard Deviation Issue:**  
  Calculated without considering the periodic nature of the data, the arithmetic standard deviation would treat the jump from 359° to 1° as a 358° difference, thereby overestimating the dispersion.
- **Circular Standard Deviation Advantage:**  
  By effectively “wrapping” the angles, the circular standard deviation correctly recognizes that 359° and 1° are very close, giving a lower and more accurate measure of dispersion.

| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Circular Mean**               | Indicates that most phase values cluster around a specific reference angle (e.g., 0° or another expected phase offset), reflecting high coherence in that aspect.                     | Indicates an average phase (e.g., around 180°) that may result from expected physical offsets, but doesn't imply dispersion quality by itself.                      |
| **Circular Standard Deviation** | A low value means the phase measurements are tightly clustered around the circular mean (e.g., in areas with uniform scattering like calm water), signaling high coherence.           | A high value shows that the phase measurements are widely spread (e.g., in rough or noisy areas), reflecting low coherence and increased uncertainty in phase data. |
| **Regular Mean/Std. Deviation** | Regular arithmetic statistics can mislead: e.g., a mix of 1° and 359° might yield an arithmetic mean of 180° and an inflated standard deviation, misrepresenting the true clustering. | Regular measures fail by not accounting for the 0°/360° wrap-around, often overestimating dispersion and misplacing the central tendency.                           |

### 5. Practical Implications in SAR Imagery Interpretation

- **Phase Unwrapping:**  
  In interferometric SAR, accurate phase unwrapping depends on correctly assessing the central tendency and dispersion of phase values. Circular statistics provide robust estimates that prevent misinterpretation caused by artificial jumps at the wrap-around boundaries.

- **Noise Identification:**  
  A low circular standard deviation in a region that is physically expected to be heterogeneous might hint at an over-smoothing process or an error in data processing. Conversely, a high circular standard deviation in an area expected to be uniform (like calm water) may signal decorrelation or noise issues.

- **Physical Models:**  
  In scenarios like urban monitoring or terrain mapping, being aware of the actual mean phase helps in correcting for phase shifts due to known features (buildings, slopes, etc.), while the dispersion offers a metric for the reliability of the phase data.

This detailed explanation should clarify how low and high values in circular phase statistics are interpreted and why circular measures are vastly superior to regular arithmetic statistics when applied to angular data like that from SAR imagery.

*My interest is thus: I have Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, in particular, Single Look Complex (SLC) data, which has been deliberately minimally processed (Level 1 product) with only flipping, de-bursting and no data masking. I want to prepare the data for input to train a YOLOv11 model. The input will comprise 3 channels (VH mag, VH phase and a zeros channel) to conform with the 3 channel input required by YOLOv11. I believe YOLOv11 has built-in pre-processing that includes scaling/normalization of input images and uses fixed normalization values ([0.0, 0.0, 0.0] for mean and [255.0, 255.0, 255.0] for std) that scale pixel values to 0-1 range by default, rather than dataset-specific calculations. My SLC data has not had any scaling applied. Assuming I bypass YOLOv11 pre-processing, how should I prepare my data?*

Let's break down a recommended pre-processing workflow assuming you want to bypass YOLOv11’s built-in normalization and feed it data that are already on a comparable scale.

---

### 1. Understand Your Data Channels

You’re preparing a three-channel input:

- **VH Magnitude Channel:** This is the amplitude of the radar return, typically non-negative and with a dynamic range that depends on the sensor and scene. Sometimes these values span a large range, and a logarithmic (dB) transformation is common in radar processing.
- **VH Phase Channel:** This is an angular measurement (often in radians, within [–π, π] or [0, 2π]). Because it is cyclic, a linear interpretation isn’t valid. YOLO itself doesn’t inherently know about circularity, so you must map it to a normalized range.
- **Zeros Channel:** This channel is mostly a placeholder to meet the three-channel requirement of YOLOv11.

For effective training, each channel should be scaled to a consistent range (typically [0, 1] or [0, 255]) so that the network input space is homogeneous.

---

### 2. Scaling the Magnitude Channel

- **Option A: Linear Scaling (if the data range is limited):**  
  If your VH magnitude values already lie in a modest range (for example, 0 to some known maximum), you can apply: 
  
  $$
  mag\_norm = \frac{mag - \min(mag)}{\max(mag) - \min(mag)}
  $$
  
  This maps the values to [0, 1].

- **Option B: Logarithmic (dB) Scaling (if the dynamic range is very high):**  
  SAR amplitude data is often log-transformed to compress its dynamic range:
  
  1. Compute a dB scale:  
     
     $$
     mag\_dB = 20 \log_{10}(mag + \epsilon)
     $$
  
  2. Then normalize the dB values to [0, 1] (using min/max normalization or percentile clipping to manage outliers).

Choose based on your data characteristics and what best preserves the details you expect YOLOv11 to use for object detection.

---

### 3. Scaling the Phase Channel

The phase is cyclic, so the procedure is different from a standard linear scaling. Here are the common steps:

- **Mapping to a [0, 1] Range:**  
  If your phase is in the interval $[0, 2\pi]$, divide by $2\pi$: 
  
  $$
  phase\_norm = \frac{phase}{2\pi}
  $$
  
  If the phase is in $[-\pi, \pi]$, first shift it:
  
  $$
  phase\_shifted = phase + \pi
  $$
  
  Then divide by $2\pi$ to map to [0, 1]:
  
  $$
  phase\_norm = \frac{phase\_shifted}{2\pi}
  $$

- **Why This Matters:**  
  By doing this, you ensure that the cyclic nature is preserved and YOLO receives the phase information in a standard normalized interval, avoiding any artificial discontinuities at the boundaries.

---

### 4. Preparing the Zeros Channel

This channel is straightforward. Create an array of the same spatial dimensions as the other channels filled with zeros. For consistency, if your other channels are normalized to [0, 1], the zeros naturally match that range.

---

### 5. Stacking and Final Considerations

1. **Stack Channels:**  
   Once pre-processed, stack the normalized magnitude, the normalized phase, and the zeros channel together to form a 3-channel image. For instance, in Python (using NumPy):
   
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   
   # Assuming mag_norm, phase_norm are arrays of shape (H, W) with values in [0, 1]
   zeros_channel = np.zeros_like(mag_norm)
   image_input = np.stack((mag_norm, phase_norm, zeros_channel), axis=-1)  # shape becomes (H, W, 3)
   ```

2. **Bypassing YOLOv11 Pre-processing:**  
   Since you plan to bypass YOLOv11’s internal normalization (which would normally assume inputs are in [0, 255] and then scale them to [0, 1]), it’s crucial that your output is already in the range that your model expects (ideally [0, 1]). Verify the expected input range by checking YOLOv11 configurations if needed.

3. **Dataset-specific Statistics:**  
   Even though you are bypassing the built-in normalization, you might consider computing dataset-specific statistics (mean and std) later to assess whether additional scaling or contrast enhancement is needed. However, with your controlled channels, a fixed normalization (i.e., mapping to [0, 1]) is typically sufficient.

---

### 6. Example Workflow Recap

- **Step 1:** For your magnitude channel, choose between linear or logarithmic scaling depending on the observed dynamic range.
- **Step 2:** For the phase channel, shift (if necessary) and scale to [0, 1] by dividing by the full circle ($2\pi$).
- **Step 3:** Create a zeros channel that simply fills the third channel.
- **Step 4:** Stack these three channels for each SLC image to form a 3-channel image.
- **Step 5:** Confirm that each pixel value in your combined image is in the [0, 1] range.

By manually preparing your data this way, you remove the dependency on YOLOv11’s built-in processing and ensure that your model receives data consistently. This is especially important if your SAR-derived information requires a more nuanced or physically meaningful scaling than a fixed normalization can provide.

---

### 7. Final Thoughts and Next Steps

Since SAR data, and especially SLC, contain rich and often subtle information, carefully verifying the integrity of each channel after scaling is key. You might want to:

- Visualize individual channels (or their histograms) to check that the dynamic range looks correct.
- Experiment with different scaling parameters (especially for the magnitude channel) to see which yields the best performance in preliminary YOLOv11 experiments.
- Consider data augmentation techniques that respect the physics of SAR—rotations and flips are fine, but take care with operations that might affect the phase continuity.

Thanks for providing these statistics! They offer valuable insight into the distribution of amplitude and phase values, which is critical for designing an effective normalization strategy for YOLOv11 training.

### **1. Observations from the Data:**

- **Amplitude Statistics:**
  
  - The mean amplitude (13.85) and standard deviation (14.10) suggest a reasonable dynamic range, but the maximum value (1791.40) is extremely high, indicating a long-tailed distribution.
  - Given this large range, a simple linear scaling might not be ideal. Instead, **logarithmic scaling** (e.g., converting to decibels) could compress the dynamic range and preserve subtle contrast details.

- **Phase Statistics:**
  
  - The **linear phase mean (0.1239 rad)** and **standard deviation (1.8025 rad)** imply relatively uniform phase distribution.
  - The **circular mean (-0.0005 rad)** and **circular standard deviation (2.8017 rad)** indicate that the phase values are spread widely across the full angular range, reinforcing the need for circular normalization.

- **Real/Imaginary Components:**
  
  - Their near-zero mean values confirm balanced scattering, but their standard deviations (~13.97) align with the amplitude spread, which reinforces the amplitude normalization approach.

### **2. Pre-Processing Approach for YOLOv11:**

#### **Amplitude Channel Normalization:**

- Given the high dynamic range, apply **log transformation** to enhance contrast:
  
  Choose (\epsilon) carefully to prevent log(0) errors (e.g., $\epsilon = 10^{-6}$).
  
  $$
  VH\_mag\_dB = 20 \log*{10} (VH\_mag + \epsilon)
  $$
  
  Normalize to [0,1] after transformation using min-max scaling.

#### **Phase Channel Normalization:**

- Since phase is cyclic and bounded within $[-\pi, \pi]$ or $[0, 2\pi]$, normalize it using:

  $$
  phase\_norm = \frac{phase + \pi}{2\pi}
  $$

  Maps phase values to [0,1], ensuring circular continuity.

#### **Zeros Channel Preparation:**

- Create a placeholder array of zeros with the same dimensions to complete the 3-channel input.

### **3. Implementation in Python:**

Here's how you could implement this in NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Assume VH_mag and VH_phase are numpy arrays
epsilon = 1e-6  # To prevent log(0)

# Amplitude Processing: Log scaling then normalization
VH_mag_dB = 20 * np.log10(VH_mag + epsilon)
VH_mag_norm = (VH_mag_dB - VH_mag_dB.min()) / (VH_mag_dB.max() - VH_mag_dB.min())

# Phase Processing: Normalize to [0,1]
VH_phase_norm = (VH_phase + np.pi) / (2 * np.pi)

# Zeros Channel
zeros_channel = np.zeros_like(VH_mag)

# Stack into (H, W, 3) format
image_input = np.stack((VH_mag_norm, VH_phase_norm, zeros_channel), axis=-1)
```

### **4. Validation & Next Steps**

- **Histogram Analysis:** Before finalizing, check histograms to confirm the scaling preserves contrast.
- **Augmentation Strategy:** Consider ensuring that rotations maintain phase continuity and that transformations don’t distort the input interpretation.
- **Model Testing:** Run a few YOLOv11 inference tests to verify if the scaled inputs behave well under training.
